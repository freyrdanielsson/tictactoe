# tic tac toe!

## Temporal Difference learning

This reffers to the [tictac_td.py](tictac_td.py) python script.
Here the program learns by finding an optimal value function competing with itself a 10000 times

## Monte Carlo
This reffers to the [ttt_montecarlo.py](ttt_montecarlo.py) python script.
Here the program also learns by competing with itself but one of the players uses TD learning and the other one uses a Monte Carlo rollback !
* TODO
  - Plot out the results
  
## Putting the agent to the test!
This reffers to the [tictac_vsPlayer.py](tictac_vsPlayer.py) python script.
Here the agent learns by itself and after doing so it is put to the test against a human.


### The test.py
[test.py](test.py) is my first python program. Please do not judge me üéÖüèΩ.
